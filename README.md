# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. Not meant to be shared, but feel free to take a look if you want to.

## Subtrees

I'm trying out `git subtree` to bring in dependencies. I know of no way to list
them easily, so I'll try to keep a list of them here:

* `.config/i3blocks/contrib` https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks-contrib
* `.config/zsh/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting` https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git
